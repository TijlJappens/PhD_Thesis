	abstract = {When a flux quantum is pushed through a gapped two- dimensional tight-binding operator, there is an associated spectral flow through the gap which is shown to be equal to the index of a Fredholm operator encoding the topology of the Fermi projection. This is a natural mathematical formulation of Laughlin's Gedankenexperiment. It is used to provide yet another proof of the bulk-edge correspondence. Furthermore, when applied to systems with time reversal symmetry, the spectral flow has a characteristic {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}2{\}}{\$}{\$}signature, while for particle--hole symmetric systems it leads to a criterion for the existence of zero energy modes attached to half-flux tubes. Combined with other results, this allows to explain all strong invariants of two-dimensional topological insulators in terms of a single Fredholm operator.},

	abstract = {A number of proposals with differing predictions (e.g. Borel group cohomology, oriented cobordism, group supercohomology, spin cobordism, etc) have been made for the classification of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. Here we treat various proposals on an equal footing and present rigorous, general results that are independent of which proposal is correct. We do so by formulating a minimalist generalized cohomology hypothesis, which is satisfied by existing proposals and captures essential aspects of SPT classification. From this hypothesis alone, formulas relating classifications in different dimensions and/or protected by different symmetry groups are derived. Our formalism is expected to work for fermionic as well as bosonic phases, Floquet as well as stationary phases, and spatial as well as on-site symmetries. As an application, we predict that the complete classification of 3D bosonic SPT phases with space group symmetry G is , where the H1 term classifies phases beyond the Borel group cohomology proposal.},
