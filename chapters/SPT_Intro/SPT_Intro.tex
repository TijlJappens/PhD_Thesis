\chapter{Symmetry protected topological order in a nutshell}\label{sec:SPT_Order_In_A_Nutshell}
\section{Gapped phases of matter}\label{sec:GappedPhasesOfMatterIntro}
All of these topological phases of matter are described by a Hamiltonian that is gapped\footnote{There are some caveats to this statement. For instance, one can still observe the quantum Hall effect in regimes where there is no gap.} and local. By local, we mean that it is a sum of local terms\footnote{As presented here, this is not yet a mathematically well-defined concept. For instance, in the infinite volume limit, there is no one Hilbert space containing every state. Therefore, it is not clear how to define such operators. In Section \ref{sec:ToolsForQuantumManyBody} we will define these concepts in more detail.}. It turns out that this locality and gap protect the topological orders mentioned in the last section. To explain this more precisely we will define two equivalence classes. The first equivalence class is an equivalence on Hamiltonians:
\begin{definition}[Equivalence of Hamiltonians]\label{def:ConnectedHamiltonians}
	Two local Hamiltonians, with unique gapped ground states, $H_0$ and $H_1$ are connected if there exists a path $t\mapsto H(t)$ such that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $H(0)=H_0$ and $H(1)=H_1$.
		\item for each $t\in[0,1]$, $H(t)$ is local.
		\item each of the local terms of $H(t)$ is continuous in $t$.
		\item there is a uniform lower bound on the gap ($\sup_{t\in[0,1]}\textrm{Gap}(H(t))>\delta$).
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The second equivalence class is an equivalence on states:
\begin{definition}[Equivalence of states]\label{def:ConnectedStates}
	Two states, $\ket{\psi_0}$ and $\ket{\psi_1}$ are connected if there exists a path $t\mapsto \ket{\psi(t)}$ with $\ket{\psi(0)}=\ket{\psi_0}$ and $\ket{\psi(1)}=\ket{\psi_1}$ such that there exists a one-parameter family of local Hermitian operators $K(s)$ such that
	\begin{align}
	\ket{\psi(t)}&=V(t)\ket{\psi(0)}&V(t)&=\mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_{0}^{t}\d s K(s)).
	\end{align}
	Here $V(t)$ is the time ordered exponential of $K(t)$. It is defined as the solution of the operator valued ODE $V'(t)=-iK(t)V(t)$ with the initial condition $V(0)=\id$.
\end{definition}
In what follows we will call a unitary generated as the above $V(t)$, a locally generated unitary (LGU).\\\\
Both these concepts are equivalent. More specifically:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If two uniquely gapped local Hamiltonians, $H_0$ and $H_1$, are equivalent through a path $H(t)$, the ground states of $H(t)$ form a path satisfying definition \ref{def:ConnectedStates}.
	\item If a state $\ket{\psi_0}$ is a unique gapped ground state of some local Hamiltonian and is connected to $\ket{\psi_1}$ via a path $\ket{\psi(t)}$, there is a continuous path of parent Hamiltonians $H(t)$ for $\ket{\psi(t)}$ satisfying definition \ref{def:ConnectedHamiltonians}.
\end{itemize}
We will provide the statements in more detail along with the main ideas needed for the proof in Section \ref{sec:equivalence-of-states-vs-equivalence-of-gapped-interactions}.\\\\

	\caption{This is a graphical depiction of the quantum phases of matter. Any two states with different transverse Hall conductances have to be in different phases.}
	\label{fig:GappedPhasesOfQuantumMatter}
\end{figure}
These equivalence classes allow for a way to characterize these topological phases of matter. For example, if two of these states have different transverse Hall conductances they cannot be equivalent. We can try to generalize this notion. Suppose we take all states that can be written as the unique gapped ground state of some local Hamiltonian and then tried to label all of the connected components with respect to the above equivalence class. These connected components are then called quantum phases of matter (see figure \ref{fig:GappedPhasesOfQuantumMatter}).
\section{Finite depth quantum circuits}\label{sec:finite-depth-quantum-circuits}
\begin{figure}

	\caption{This figure shows a one-dimensional lattice. It then also shows the algebraic structure of local operators. If one multiplies a an operator with support on $\{i,i+1\}$ with an operator having support on $\{i+1,i+2\}$, one obtains an operator having support on $\{i,i+1,i+2\}$.}

	\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit.tikz}
	\caption{Example of a finite depth quantum circuit with two layers being displayed.}
	\label{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquit}
\end{figure}
In this section, we will define a particularly simple set of examples of these LGUs called finite depth quantum circuits (FDQC). To examine what they are, envision one has a lattice $\Lambda$. In figure \ref{fig:Lattice} we give a graphical depiction of the one-dimensional lattice $\ZZ$.\footnote{All of the definitions in this section however can be generalized to other lattices.} To each site of the lattice we attach a Hilbert space, say $\CC^d$ (for some small integer $d$). The full Hilbert space is then $\HH=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}\CC^d$.\footnote{For infinite lattices like $\Lambda=\ZZ$ or $\Lambda=\ZZ^2$, this Hilbert space cannot be defined. More on this in Section \ref{sec:ToolsForQuantumManyBody}.} One then defines a local operator as an operator that acts on the tensor product of a few sites and acts trivially on the other sites (these sites are then called the support of the operator). These local operators form an algebra as multiplying two local operators gives a new local operator (an example of this is given in figure \ref{fig:Lattice}).
\\\\
We now create a unitary on this full Hilbert space of the following form (see figure \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquit} for a graphical depiction). We first create an even layer which is an operator of the form $V_1=\bigotimes_{i}V_{1,i}$ where $V_{1,i}$ has support on sites $2i$ and $2i+1$. Next, we create an odd layer which is of the same form only $V_{2,i}$ has support on sites $2i-1$ and $2i$. A unitary that is a product of odd layers and even layers is called a finite depth quantum circuit (FDQC). The amount of layers used is then called the depth. So a circuit of depth $D$ is a unitary of the form $V_D\cdots V_1$ where the $V_i$ alternate between even and odd layers.\\\\
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/FiniteDepthQuantumCircuitLightcone.tikz}
	\caption{This figure displays the operator $\Ad{V}(A)$ where $V$ is a finite depth quantum circuit and $A$ is an operator with small support. The only unitaries in the FDQC that contribute in $\Ad{V}(A)$ are indicated in yellow. The other ones will cancel with the corresponding unitaries in $V^\dagger$. In general, this implies that the diameter of the support of $\Ad{V}(A)$ is bounded by $\text{diam}(A)+2D$.}
	\label{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLightcone}
\end{figure}
In this setting, one should think of the depth $D$ as being a lot smaller than the total amount of sites $L$. In this case, a quantum circuit has two very important properties that we want to use. The first one is that a FDQC is indeed an LGU. This can be easily seen from the fact that for any of the local unitaries $V_{i,j}\in\UU(\CC^d\otimes\CC^d)$, we can find a Hermitian operator $K_{i,j}\in\textrm{Herm}(\CC^d\otimes\CC^d)$ such that
\begin{equation}
V_{i,j}=\exp(-i K_{i,j}).
\end{equation}
If we now define the sum of local terms operator
\begin{equation}
K(s)\defeq \left\{\begin{matrix}
\sum_{j}(K_{1,j})_{2j,2j+1}&\text{if }0<s<1/D\\
\sum_{j}(K_{2,j})_{2j-1,2j}&\text{if }1/D<s<2/D\\
\vdots&\vdots
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}
(here $D$ was the depth of the FDQC) then we indeed obtain that
\begin{equation}
V=\mathcal{T}\exp(-iD\int_0^1 \d s K(s)).
\end{equation}
This means in particular that any two states that are connected through a FDQC are also connected as in definition \ref{def:ConnectedStates}. Moreover the depth is linearly proportional to the norm of the required Hamiltonian.
\\\\
The second one is that a FDQC preserves the locality of operators. More specifically we will show that the diameter of the support of
\begin{equation}
	\Ad{V}(A)\defeq V A V^\dagger,
\end{equation}
with $V$ a finite depth quantum circuit, grows only linearly with the depth of $V$. To see this take an operator $A$ with support contained in some diameter $\text{diam}(A)$. As is shown in figure \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLightcone}, if one now works out $\Ad{V}(A)$ one observes that this operator only depends on the unitaries in a particular lightcone around the support of $A$. This implies that the diameter of the support of $\Ad{V}(A)$ is bounded by $\text{diam}(A)+2D$. This means that a FDQC preserves the locality of operators. There is a generalization of this signal locality (as it is sometimes called) to any LGU. This generalization is called the Lieb-Robinson bound and is described in Section \ref{sec:ToolsForQuantumManyBody}.

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{SPT_Phases.pdf}
	\caption{This figure shows all states connected to some trivial product state $\ket{\phi}$. The highlighted black area displays all states connected to $\ket{\phi}$ via a generic LGU while the green areas show the $G$-invariant states that are connected via a $G$-invariant LGU.}
	\label{fig:ConnectedComponents}
\end{figure}
FDQCs give a first way to compare topological phases of matter. If two many-body ground states can be mapped into one another via a FDQC, they are in the same quantum phase of matter. It now makes sense to look at what the trivial quantum phase of matter looks like (in the Landau picture the trivial phase was the symmetry-preserving phase). To this end, we first define the most trivial state we can think of which is called the product state. It is a state that has no entanglement between any of its sites. On the Hilbert space above, one could define a product state by fixing a vector $\ket{v_i}\in\CC^d$ for each lattice site $i$ and defining $\ket{\phi_0}=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}\ket{v_i}$. We now call a state $\ket{\psi}\in\HH$, short-range entangled (SRE) if there exists an LGU, $U$ such that $\ket{\psi}=U\ket{\phi_0}$.\\\\
These SRE states then form, by construction, the topologically trivial quantum phase of matter. They can in a local and smooth way be deformed to the most trivial state of all. The kind of topological order that we will discuss in this thesis is precisely the topological order that emerges when one applies an additional symmetry to this trivial phase. To this end, take a group $G$\footnote{Later on we will only talk about finite groups but for now the reader can think of any compact Lie Group.}. Now for each site $i$, take a unitary representation on the on-site Hilbert space $U_i\in\hom(G,U(\CC^d))$.\footnote{Here, $\hom(G,H)$ is the set of group homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$.} Use this to define a representation on the full Hilbert $U\in\hom(G,U(\HH))$ such that $U(g)=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}U_i(g)$. If we graphically depict this in the same way as we did for the finite depth quantum circuits it looks like in figure \ref{fig:GroupActionQuantumCirquit}.\\\\
We now call an SRE state $\ket{\psi}$, $G$-invariant, if $U(g)\ket{\psi}=\ket{\psi}$ for all $g\in G$. We will put a similar but slightly stronger condition on product states and say that a product state $\ket{\phi_0}$ is $G$-trivial if $U_i(g)\ket{\phi_0}=\ket{\phi_0}$ for all $i\in\Lambda$ and all $g\in G$. Finally, we call a FDQC, $G$-invariant if each of the unitaries $U_{ij}$ in the FDQC commutes with the group action $U(g)$. Equivalently a FDQC is $G$-invariant if each of its layers commutes with the group action.\\\\
We can now define SPT phases through the following procedure (see figure \ref{fig:ConnectedComponents}). First, pick a $G$-trivial product state $\ket{\phi_0}$. Take all states connected to $\ket{\phi_0}$ via some finite depth quantum circuit. Now out of those states pick only the $G$-invariant ones and group them together if they can be connected via a $G$-invariant FDQC. The groups obtained are now called the SPT phases.
\section{Zero dimensional SPTs}\label{sec:zero-dimensional-spts}The first example that we will give is when the lattice is trivial $\Lambda=\{1\}$. In this case, the total Hilbert space is the same as the on-site Hilbert space and the group action $U\in\hom(G,U(\CC^d))$ is just a finite-dimensional representation. A state $\ket{\psi}\in\CC^d$ is then $G$-invariant if there exists an $\alpha:G\rightarrow U(1)$ such that
\begin{equation}
U(g)\ket{\psi}=\alpha(g)\ket{\psi}.
\end{equation}
However, since
\begin{equation}
U(g)U(h)\ket{\psi}=U(gh)\ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
we need that $\alpha(g)\alpha(h)=\alpha(gh)$ and therefore $\alpha\in\hom(G,U(1))$. The trivial state is then the state such that $\alpha=1$. We therefore say that the zero-dimensional SPTs are classified by the $U(1)$-representations $\hom(G,U(1))$. We will see in subsection \ref{sec:example-1-h1gtt} that this group is the same as the so-called first group cohomology group.
\\\\
At this point, the reader might wonder, why this is called the zero-dimensional SPT index. Any SPT should be characterized by a vector on some Hilbert space and hence, we should be able to define a zero-dimensional SPT index for any SPT in any dimension. However, it turns out that this is not true. In Section \ref{sec:equal-at-infinity} we will discuss how only states that look the same at infinity can be seen as vectors in the same Hilbert space. This implies that we can break the zero-dimensional SPT index by allowing zero-dimensional charge to escape to infinity. An example of this process is the creation of the boundary state that we will discuss in Section \ref{sec:the-boundary-state}.
\section{An example in 1d: The Haldane phase}\label{sec:an-example-in-1d-the-haldane-phase}
The next example is a slightly less trivial one. We will now take the one-dimensional lattice $\Lambda=\ZZ$.\footnote{As discussed before, this means the full Hilbert space is not a well-defined object. We will for now however choose to ignore this and revisit it in Section \ref{sec:ToolsForQuantumManyBody}.} In this example we will take as group $\ZZ_2\times\ZZ_2$\footnote{We can extend this group in a straightforward way to $SO(3)$ using the double covering, $f:SU(2)\rightarrow SO(3)$.}. We write the four group elements of $\ZZ_2\times\ZZ_2$ as
\begin{align}
&(1,1)&&(-1,1)&&(1,-1)&&(-1,-1).
\end{align}
The group multiplication is then given by pointwise multiplication of these numbers.
\subsection{The on-site group action}
As on-site Hilbert space, we take $\CC^4\cong \CC^2\otimes\CC^2$. As on-site group action we take the unitary representation $u:\ZZ_2\times\ZZ_2\rightarrow U(\CC^2\otimes\CC^2)$ defined through
\begin{align}\label{eq:OnSiteActionOfFakeAKLT_Model}
u(1,1)&=\id_{\CC^4}&u(-1,1)&=-\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x&u(1,-1)&=-\sigma_y\otimes\sigma_y&u(-1,-1)&=-\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z.
\end{align}
We then take a copy of this unitary for each site and this gives our group action $U(g)=\bigotimes_{i=1}^{L}u(g)$. Finally, we will need to define a basis for $\CC^4$ that we will use to define our state. We will take the singlet and triplet basis:
\begin{align}
&&\ket{s}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}-\ket{\downarrow\uparrow})&&\\
\ket{0}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}+\ket{\downarrow\uparrow})&\ket{-1}&=\ket{\downarrow\downarrow}&\ket{1}&=\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}.
\end{align}
The singlet is now invariant under the group action ($u(g)\ket{s}=\ket{s}$ for all $g\in G$) while the group action acts irreducibly on the three triplet vectors.
\subsection{Intermezzo: Linear and projective representations}
We can rewrite the unitaries in equation \eqref{eq:OnSiteActionOfFakeAKLT_Model} as
\begin{align}\label{eq:OnSiteActionOfFakeAKLT_Model_Rewritten}
u(1,1)&=\id_{\CC^2}\otimes\id_{\CC^2}&u(-1,1)&=(i\sigma_x)\otimes(i\sigma_x)\\
\nonumber
u(1,-1)&=(i\sigma_y)\otimes(i\sigma_y)&u(-1,-1)&=(i\sigma_z)\otimes(i\sigma_z).
\end{align}
One could therefore wonder whether
\begin{align}\label{eq:OnSiteActionOfFakeAKLT_Model_OnC2}
r(1,1)&=\id_{\CC^2}&r(-1,1)&=i\sigma_x&r(1,-1)&=i\sigma_y&r(-1,-1)&=i\sigma_z
\end{align}
is a representation. It turns out this is not the case. This can easily be seen by the fact that $r(-1,1)$ and $r(1,-1)$ don't commute. $r$ does however commute up to a phase. More specifically, define $[\cdot]_\sim$ as the equivalence class that says that two operators are equivalent if they differ only up to a phase. Then $\tilde{r}$, defined through
\begin{align}\label{eq:OnSiteActionOfFakeAKLT_Model_OnC2_ProjectiveRep}
\tilde r(1,1)&=[\id_{\CC^2}]_\sim&\tilde r(-1,1)&=[\sigma_x]_\sim\\
\nonumber
\tilde r(1,-1)&=[\sigma_y]_\sim&\tilde r(-1,-1)&=[\sigma_z]_\sim
\end{align}
is a representation ($\tilde{r}\in\hom(G,\PP\UU(\CC^2))$). We call such an $\tilde{r}$ a projective representation and we call $r$ then the lift of a projective representation.
\subsection{The trivial product state and the entangled pair state}

	\caption{These are two $\ZZ_2\times\ZZ_2$ invariant states. The first one is a trivial state the other one is an SRE state. Each dot represents the Hilbert space $\CC^2$, each circle indicates that out of $\CC^2\otimes\CC^2$, the singlet state is chosen. The dots that are near each other form a site.}
	\label{fig:TheTwoHaldanePhases}
\end{figure}
Now we define the trivial product state. As $\ket{s}$ was the only invariant vector in $\CC^4$ the trivial product state is simply $\ket{\phi}=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}\ket{s}_{i_L,i_R}$. Figure \ref{fig:TrivialProductState} gives a graphical representation of this state. Similarly, we can also construct a nontrivial state. We simply take $\ket{\psi}=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}\ket{s}_{i_R,(i+1)_L}$\footnote{For open boundary conditions, we did not specify what we do with the sites $1_L$ and $L_R$. This state can only be made $G$ invariant if one places it in periodic boundary conditions or if one defines it on the infinite lattice (which is what we will do later on in the thesis). This is related to Section \ref{sec:gapless-edge-mode}.}. We call this state the entangled pair state\footnote{This is related to the AKLT state named after this paper: \cite{PhysRevLett.59.799}. It differs from the real AKLT state in that we only construct the entangled pairs here, we don't project the sites to the triplets (see Section \ref{sec:from-the-entangled-pair-state-to-the-projective-entangled-pair-state}).}. This state is also a product of $G$-invariant states and is therefore by construction $G$-invariant as well.\\\\
We constructed two $G$-invariant states. One of them is a trivial product state. Now we would like to argue that the other state is a state with nontrivial SPT order. To do this we must do two things.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item we have to show that they can be connected via a finite depth quantum circuit.
	\item we have to show that they cannot be connected via a $G$-invariant finite depth quantum circuit.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/FakeAKLT_IsSRE.tikz}
	\caption{This figure displays a finite depth quantum circuit of depth 3 mapping the trivial product state to the entangled pair state. As before the curves indicate singlet states and the dots without curves around them indicate $\ket{\uparrow}$ states. The $U$ here is therefore a unitary on $\CC^4$ that maps the $\ket{s}$ state to the $\ket{1}=\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}$ state.}
	\label{fig:FakeAKLT_IsSRE}
\end{figure}
To show the first point, first let $U$ be a unitary on $\CC^4$ that maps $\ket{s}$ to $\ket{1}=\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}$. We now create a finite depth quantum circuit $V$ consisting of three layers. Look at figure \ref{fig:FakeAKLT_IsSRE} for a schematic picture of the layers of $V$. The first layer is both odd and even, $V_1=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}U_{i_L,i_R}$ (it rotates the sites themselves). The second layer is odd, $V_2=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}U_{(2i-1)_R,2i_L}^\dagger$. The third layer is even, $V_3=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}U_{2i_R,(2i+1)_L}^\dagger$. This concludes our FDQC.

	\caption{This shows how we can decompose the trivial product state and the entangled pair state into a left and right part.}
	\label{fig:TheTwoHaldanePhasesTwoParts}
\end{figure}
In this section, we will highlight a very important fact that will eventually explain why there doesn't exist a $G$-invariant finite depth quantum circuit connecting $\ket{\phi}$ and $\ket{\psi}$. The distinction will be that the right half of $\ket{\phi}$ will transform linearly under the group action while the right half of $\ket{\psi}$ transforms projectively, To make this more precise, let $\textrm{Tr}_L$ be the partial trace that traces out the left part of the Hilbert space\footnote{Again, since our lattice is infinite, the total Hilbert space does not exist and therefore it is not straightforward to define this operation. This will be fixed in Subsection \ref{sec:the-gns-representation} where we will define the GNS Hilbert space.}. Now look at figure \ref{fig:TheTwoHaldanePhasesTwoParts} and rewrite the two states as
\begin{align}
\ket{\phi}&=\ket{\phi_L}\otimes\ket{\phi_R}&\ket{\psi}&=\ket{\psi_L}\otimes\ket{s}\otimes\ket{\psi_R}.
\end{align}
If we now apply the partial trace on both of these states, we obtain:
\begin{align}
\textrm{Tr}_L(\ket{\phi}\bra{\phi})&=\ket{\phi_R}\bra{\phi_R}&\textrm{Tr}_L(\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})&=\frac{1}{2}(\ket{\uparrow}\bra{\uparrow}+\ket{\downarrow}\bra{\downarrow})\otimes \ket{\psi_R}\bra{\psi_R}.
\end{align}
While both of these density matrices are $G$-invariant, there is a big difference between the two. Namely, the vector $\ket{\phi_R}$ is by itself $G$-invariant while the vectors
\begin{align}
\ket{v_1}&=\ket{\uparrow}\otimes\ket{\psi_R}&\ket{v_2}&=\ket{\downarrow}\otimes\ket{\psi_R}
\end{align}
are not invariant individually but do form an invariant subspace. As we highlighted before, an irreducible representation of $\ZZ_2\otimes\ZZ_2$ on $\CC^2$ has to be a projective representation.
\begin{conclusion}
	The right half of $\ket{\phi}$ transforms linearly under the right half of the group action while the right half of $\ket{\psi}$ transforms projectively under the right half of the group action.
\end{conclusion}
\subsection{No $G$-invariant finite depth quantum circuits}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.65}{
		\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/ConnectingPsiAndPsi0Proof2_WithLightcone.tikz}
	}
	\caption{A graphical depiction of the FDQC $\tilde{V}$ that we constructed from $V$. There are three areas indicated with respect to the lightcone that are used in the proof.}	\label{fig:ConnectingPsiAndPsi0Proof2_WithLightcone}
\end{figure}
In this section, we will show that it is impossible to find a $G$-invariant FDQC that connects $\ket{\phi}$ and $\ket{\psi}$. We will show this by contradiction. To this end, assume there exists a finite depth quantum circuit $V$ such that $V\ket{\psi}=\ket{\phi}$. Now define $\tilde{V}$ as the FDQC constructed out of the following layers
\begin{equation}
\tilde{V}_i=\bigotimes_{j\leq 0}\id \bigotimes_{j> 0}V_{i,j}.
\end{equation}
In words, for every layer, this has the same unitaries as $V$ on the right of the origin while its unitaries on the left of the origin are set to the identity. This finite depth quantum circuit is depicted in figure \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLightcone}.\\\\
As is also shown in figure \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLightcone}, define $\ket{\tilde{\psi}}\defeq \tilde{V}\ket{\psi}$. We will now prove that $\ket{\tilde{\psi}}$ cannot be $G$-invariant. If we prove this, we will have shown that $\tilde{V}$ couldn't have been a $G$-invariant FDQC. To this end, first notice that for all local operators $a_L\in\AA_L$ and $a_R\in\AA_R$ (where $\AA_L$ and $\AA_R$ are highlighted in figure \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLightcone}) we get that
\begin{align}
\bra{\tilde{\psi}}a_L\ket{\tilde{\psi}}&=\bra{\psi}a_L\ket{\psi}&\bra{\tilde{\psi}}a_R\ket{\tilde{\psi}}&=\bra{\phi}a_L\ket{\phi}.
\end{align}
This implies that $\tilde{\psi}$ transforms under the group action on $L$ as a projective representation while it transforms under the group action on $R$, one-dimensionally and therefore trivially. Since the entire state, $\ket{\tilde{\psi}}$ should be invariant under the group action we require that the projective representation of the group action on the left is cancelled by the group action in the $C$-part (see again figure \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLightcone}). However, the group action on the center is just a finite product of on-site group actions. The on-site group action was linear and a finite product of linear representations is linear. This means that $\ket{\tilde{\psi}}$ cannot be $G$-invariant concluding the proof.
\begin{remark}
	We have swept a lot of details under the table in this proof. For instance, we speak about the group action on $L$ or on $R$ but since this is an infinitely large region, there is no well-defined notion of a full Hilbert space and therefore we cannot speak about the group action on these regions. However, this will be fixed in Section \ref{sec:the-gns-representation} as we will introduce the GNS Hilbert space.
\end{remark}
\subsection{From the entangled pair state to the projective entangled pair state}\label{sec:from-the-entangled-pair-state-to-the-projective-entangled-pair-state}
The states constructed so far in this section are all very trivial. The only difference between the $G$-invariant product state and the non-trivial state lies in what we call a site. If we shift our lattice by half a site then what was previously called non-trivial will now be trivial and vice versa.
\\\\
This needn't be true in general. In fact, we will use the entangled pair state to construct a different state on a different lattice that shows this. This new system uses an on-site group action that only includes the triplet. To this end, let $P:\CC^4\rightarrow \CC^3$ be the projector from $\CC^2\otimes\CC^2$ to the triplet subspace $\CC^3$. Also, let $E:\CC^3\rightarrow \CC^4$, be the opposite embedding and let $u$ be the representation on $\CC^4$ defined through equation \ref{eq:OnSiteActionOfFakeAKLT_Model}. The triplet group action, defined by
\begin{equation}
	u_s(g)=P u(g) E
\end{equation}
is still a linear representation ($u_s\in\hom(G,\UU(\CC^3))$).
\\\\
Of course, the space over the one-dimensional lattice $\ZZ$, and the on-site Hilbert space given by the triplet $\CC^3$, doesn't have a $G$-invariant product state. Therefore, we will define our sites such that the on-site Hilbert space includes two triplets $\CC^3\otimes\CC^3\sim \CC^9$. This Hilbert space, with group action given by $g\mapsto u_s(g)\otimes u_s(g)$, does have an invariant vector. Call the product state over this invariant vector $\ket{\phi}$.
\\\\
Now, we need to create a non-trivial state in the same space. The state we will create is often called the projective entangled pair state (PEPs)\cite{Cirac_2021}. We will do this as follows. Take the entangled pair state and call it $\ket{\psi^{(0)}}$. Then project all the sites in some box to the triplet space $\CC^3$ and renormalize\footnote{We will not show here that this does not give zero.} the state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi^{(i+1)}}=\frac{1}{N_i}P_{[-i,i]}\ket{\psi^{(0)}}.
\end{equation}
The limit, $\ket{\psi}$ exists and is called the projective entangled pair state or PEPs. In this case, the PEPs constructed is rather famous and is called the AKLT state. It turns out that this resulting state is also in the non-trivial Haldane phase. Moreover, the state is completely translation invariant and is therefore not dependent on the choice of sites.

		\label{fig:EdgeMagnetization}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Two figures from \cite{sompet2022realizing}.}
	\label{fig:EdgeModesInHaldanePhaseBoth}
\end{figure}
So far, we have seen that the right half of the system can transform as a projective representation or as a linear representation. It turns out that this has some surprising consequences for the ground state degeneracy if we were to introduce an edge.
\\\\
More specifically, suppose we have an infinitely large system on a one-dimensional lattice. Assume we have a Hamiltonian that is a sum of $G$-invariant local terms $H=\sum_{i\in\ZZ} H_i$. Suppose that the total Hilbert space is a product between the right part and the left part of the system $\HH=\HH_L\otimes\HH_R$. We can then define $H_R=\sum_{i>0}H_i$ as the sum of all local terms that act trivially on $\HH_L$. We can now see the ground state of $H_R$ as a subspace of $\HH_R$. We will call it $\mathcal{V}_R$. The vectors in $\mathcal{V}_R$ are sometimes called the edge modes (as it is a Hilbert space that emerges if one introduces an edge).
\\\\
Since $H_R$ is a $G$-invariant operator (it is a sum over $G$-invariant terms), we need that $\mathcal{V}_R$ is a $G$-invariant subspace. However, if the bulk of the system is non-trivial the right half of the system has to transform as a projective representation. A non-trivial projective representation can never be one-dimensional. This leads us to the following statement:
\paragraph{Statement:}The edge modes of a Hamiltonian whose bulk ground state is in the non-trivial Haldane phase can never be one-dimensional.
\\\\
This statement is sometimes rephrased as: the edge modes of a non-trivial SPT are protected. In figure \ref{fig:EdgeModesInHaldanePhase} we give a graphical depiction of such edge modes.
\\\\
These edge modes can be observed in experiments. One example of such an experiment is in \cite{sompet2022realizing} (see figure \ref{fig:EdgeMagnetization}) where they are able to detect the edge modes of the non-trivial phase by measuring the average magnetization per site in a sample with nonzero total magnetization. 
\section{(Borel) Group cohomology groups}
\subsection{General algebraic definition}\label{sec:general-algebraic-definition}
In this paper, we define the Group cohomology groups using the algebraic approach. A standard reference for Group cohomology is \cite{benson1991representations}. Let $G$ be a finite group. For any $n\in\NN$ and any module $M$, let $C^n(G,M)$ (in principle this can be for any (left) G-module $M$ but in this thesis, we will always take $M=\TT$ with the addition and the trivial group action\footnote{So in particular when we write $g_1 \phi(g_2,\cdots,g_n)$ for any $\phi\in C^{n-1}(G,M)$ we will sometimes identify it simply with $\phi(g_2,\cdots,g_n)$.}) be the group of all functions from $G^n$ to $M$. We will use additive notation on this space and denote the group operator by $+$ and the inverse of an element of the group $\phi$ by $-\phi$. Now define the coboundary homomorphisms
\begin{equation}
\d^{n+1}:C^n(G,M)\mapsto C^{n+1}(G,M)
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{align}
&(\d^{n+1}\phi)(g_1,\cdots,g_{n+1})\\
\nonumber
&=g_1\phi(g_2,\cdots,g_{n+1})+\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i \phi(g_1,\cdots,g_{i-1},g_{i}g_{i+1},\cdots,g_{n+1})\\
\nonumber
&\qquad\qquad+(-1)^{n+1}\phi(g_1,\cdots,g_n).
\end{align}
The first term here means applying the left group action onto $\phi(g_2,\cdots,g_{n+1})$. However, when the group action on the module is trivial, we still like to keep the $g_1$ there for bookkeeping purposes.\\\\
Since $\d^{n+1}\circ\d^{n}=0$ this defines a cochain complex and we can define its cohomology as
\begin{equation}
H^n(G,M)=Z^n(G,M)/B^n(G,M)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
Z^n(G,M)&\defeq \ker(\d^{n+1})&B^n(G,M)&\defeq \left\{\begin{matrix}
0&\text{if }n=0\\\textrm{im}(\d^n)&\text{if }n\geq 1
\end{matrix}\right. .
\end{align}
We will sometimes call the elements of $Z^n$ cochains and the elements of $B^n$ coboundaries. In what follows we will denote the group action on $H^n(G,M)$ also in the same additive notation that we used for $C^n(G,M)$. This notation makes sense because of the property that for any $\phi_1,\phi_2\in Z^n(G,M)$ we have that $\expval{\phi_1+\phi_2}_{H^n(G,M)}=\expval{\phi_1}_{H^n(G,M)}+\expval{\phi_2}_{H^n(G,M)}$.
\begin{remark}
	In \cite{Chen_2013}, they argue that this definition of group cohomology is only the right approach for discrete groups. When we want to generalize this to any continuous group that has a well-defined Haar measure we additionally have to impose that the cochains are measurable. Group cohomology with measurable cochains is sometimes called Borel Group cohomology. We believe that it should be possible to construct a Borel Group cohomology group element from SPT states protected by any locally compact Lie group. However, this is beyond the scope of this thesis.
\end{remark}
\subsection{Example 1: $H^1(G,\TT)$}\label{sec:example-1-h1gtt}
In this section, we will show that the first group cohomology group is in one-to-one correspondence with the space of $U(1)$ representations. We will first need to define what it means for a map $\phi\in C^1(G, \TT)$ to be an element $Z^1(G,\TT)$. We obtain
\begin{equation}
d^2\phi(g_1,g_2)=\phi(g_2)-\phi(g_1g_2)+\phi(g_1)=0.
\end{equation}
This means that $\phi$ is a representation ($\phi\in\hom(G,\TT)$). We now still need to do modulo $B^1(G,\TT)$ but this is nothing but a number that does not depend on $g$ and the only such number present in $Z^1(G,\TT)$ is 1. The first group cohomology groups are related to the zero-dimensional SPTs presented in Subsection \ref{sec:zero-dimensional-spts} by going from the additive notation to the multiplicative one. More specifically, $\alpha(g)=\exp(i\phi(g))$ is a $U(1)$-representation.
\subsection{Example 2: $H^2(G,\TT)$}\label{sec:example-2-h2gtt}
In this case we have maps $\phi\in C^2(G,\TT)$. First, notice that $B^2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
B^2(G,\TT)=\{\omega\in C^2(G,\TT)|\omega(g,h)=\phi(g)+\phi(h)-\phi(gh)\}
\end{equation}
while $Z^2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
Z^2(G,\TT)=\{\omega\in C^2(G,\TT)|g_1\omega(g_2,g_3)-\omega(g_1g_2,g_3)+\omega(g_1,g_2g_3)-\omega(g_1,g_2)\}. 
\end{equation}
It turns out that for each lift of a projective representation, we can find one element of $Z^2(G,\TT)$. To see that, let $U:G\rightarrow\UU(\HH)$ be a map from the group to the unitaries on some Hilbert space. Suppose there exists an $\omega\in C^2(G,\TT)$ such that
\begin{equation}
U(g)U(h)=\exp(i\omega(g,h))U(gh).
\end{equation}
By associativity, we require that
\begin{equation}
(U(g_1)U(g_2))U(g_3)=U(g_1)(U(g_2)U(g_3)).
\end{equation}
After writing this out, one can conclude that this implies that $\omega\in Z^2(G,\TT)$.\\\\
So we have concluded that for each lift of a projective representation, we can find a two-cochain. Now we will show that if we choose a different lift of the same representation, this two-cochain only changes by a coboundary and therefore the cohomology class is independent of the choice of representative for the cohomology class. To show this, define
\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}(g)=\exp(i \phi(g))U(g).
\end{equation}
If we now write out the two-cochain for $\tilde{U}$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\omega}(g,h)=\omega(g,h)+\phi(g)+\phi(h)-\phi(gh)
\end{equation}
concluding the proof.
\section{Loops of SPTs}\label{sec:loops-of-spts}
This section is aimed at giving an introduction to the classification of loops of SPTs.
\subsection{What is a loop? What are equivalent loops?}
Let $\ket{\phi}$ be a product state. We say that a one-parameter family $t\in[0,1]\mapsto \ket{\phi(t)}$ is a loop based at $\ket{\phi}$ if
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\ket{\phi(0)}=\ket{\phi(1)}=\ket{\phi}$.
	\item there exists a one-parameter family of local Hermitian operators $K(s)$ such that
	\begin{align}
	\ket{\phi(t)}&=V(t)\ket{\phi(0)}&V(t)&=\mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_{0}^{t}\d s K(s)).
	\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
We will then call this $K$ the generator of the loop.\\\\
We now call a loop trivial if $\ket{\phi(t)}$ is $t$ independent. We will also call two loops $\ket{\phi_1(t)}$ and $\ket{\phi_2(t)}$, based at the same point, equivalent if there exist generators $K_1$ and $K_2$ for $\ket{\phi_1(t)}$ and $\ket{\phi_2(t)}$ respectively such that there is a map
\begin{equation}
(\lambda,s)\in[0,1]^2\mapsto K(\lambda,s) 
\end{equation}
satisfying that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item for all $\lambda$ and all $s$, $K(\lambda,s)$ is a sum of local terms operator.
	\item $K(0,s)=K_1(s)$ and $K(1,s)=K_2(s)$.
	\item for all $\lambda$, $s\mapsto K(\lambda,s)$, generates a loop based at $\phi$.
	\item for almost all $s\in[0,1]$, each of the local terms of $K(\lambda,s)$ is continuous in $\lambda$.
\end{enumerate}
As before we will make this structure more interesting by adding an on-site group action (see Section \ref{sec:enriching-the-trivial-phase-with-symmetry}). Similarly to what we had before, we will call a loop $t\mapsto\ket{\phi(t)}$, $G$-invariant if for all $t$, $\ket{\phi(t)}$ is $G$-invariant. We will call a generator $G$-invariant if each of its local terms is $G$-invariant. We will furthermore call two equivalent $G$-invariant loops, $G$-equivalent if the two-parameter family $K(\lambda,s)$ contains only $G$-invariant local terms.\\\\
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/FiniteDepthQuantumCircuitLoop.tikz}
	\caption{A graphical depiction of a family of loops generated by a continuous family of FDQCs.}
	\label{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLoop}
\end{figure}
As we did before we will sometimes consider the explicit case where the two-parameter family, $K(\lambda,s)$, is such that $s\mapsto K(\lambda,s)$ generates a FDQC of depth $D$ for each $\lambda$. We will call this FDQC $V(\lambda)$. We will also ask that we can take each of the local unitaries of $V(\lambda)$ to be continuous in $\lambda$\footnote{This does not immediately follow from the continuity of $K$ itself but it is nevertheless not hard to see that this assumption does not bring much loss of generality.}. A graphical depiction of such a one-parameter family of FDQC-generated loops is given in \ref{fig:FiniteDepthQuantumCirquitLoop}. If the $K(\lambda,s)$ contains only $G$-invariant local terms, the local unitaries $V_{i,j}(\lambda)$ will be $G$-invariant as well.
\subsection{Classification of loops: An example}\label{sec:classification-of-loops-an-example}
\subsubsection{Defining the loop}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{SPT_Loop_Phases.pdf}
	\caption{This figure shows all loops starting from some $G$-invariant product state (here $\ket{\phi}=\ket{\phi(0)}=\ket{\psi(0)}$). The highlighted black area displays all loops equivalent to the trivial loop (also called contractible loops) while the green areas show the $G$-invariant loops that are $G$-equivalent to each other.}
	\label{fig:ConnectedComponentsLoops}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.78}{
		\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit.tikz}
	}
	\caption{This figure displays the FDQC associated to a $U(1)$-invariant loop demonstrating a charge transport $+Q$.}
	\label{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit}
\end{figure}
The goal here is now to do the same thing as we did in the first few sections. We again highlight what we do with a figure (see figure \ref{fig:ConnectedComponentsLoops} which should be seen in contrast to figure \ref{fig:ConnectedComponents}). We first consider all loops starting from some $G$-invariant product state $\ket{\phi}$. We then look at all loops that are equivalent to the trivial loop. We call these loops contractible. Out of all contractible loops, we now look only at the $G$-invariant loops and we group together all $G$-equivalent $G$-invariant loops. These $G$-invariant loops together with this equivalence class is then called the classification of $G$-invariant loops.\\\\
Now it is again time for an example. This example considers loops on the one-dimensional lattice (over $\ZZ$). This time we will take as group $U(1)$. We will write the elements of this group as $e^{i\theta}$ where $\theta\in\TT$. Now chose an integer $Q\in\NN$ (we will later on refer to this integer as the charge). We will take as on-site Hilbert space $\CC^3$ and we will label the vectors by $\ket{-Q}$, $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{+Q}.$ Finally we let our on-site group action $U(\theta)$ be such that
\begin{align}
U(\theta)\ket{-Q}&=e^{-i Q\theta}\ket{-Q}&U(\theta)\ket{0}&=\ket{0}&U(\theta)\ket{+Q}&=e^{+iQ\theta}\ket{+Q}.
\end{align}
Now we will define a $G$-invariant loop starting from the product state
\begin{equation}
\ket{\phi}=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}\ket{0}.
\end{equation}
To do this, let $U=\exp(-iK_1)$ and let $V=\exp(-i K_2)$ where
\begin{align}
K_1&=i(\ket{0,0}\bra{-Q,+Q}-\ket{-Q,+Q}\bra{0,0})&K_2&=i(\ket{0,0}\bra{+Q,-Q}-\ket{+Q,-Q}\bra{0,0}).
\end{align}
Since $K_1$ and $K_2$ are hermitian, these are unitary operators. Furthermore, since $K_1$ and $K_2$ are $G$-invariant, they are $G$-invariant unitaries. A quick calculation shows that
\begin{align}
U\ket{0,0}&=\ket{-Q,+Q}&V \ket{0,0}&=\ket{+Q,-Q}.
\end{align}
We can now use these unitaries to create a $G$-invariant depth 2 quantum circuit. We use $U$ to create the first layer and $V$ to create the second layer. The full finite depth quantum circuit is then given by
\begin{equation}
W=\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda_{\text{odd}}}V_{i,i+1}\bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda_{\text{even}}}U_{i,i+1}.
\end{equation}
See figure \ref{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit} for a graphical depiction of this FDQC.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.78}{
		\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuitContraction.tikz}
	}
	\caption{This figure displays the (non $G$-invariant) contraction of the loop displayed in figure \ref{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit}.}
	\label{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit_Contraction}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Non $G$-invariant contraction}
Now we will show That this loop is contractible in a non $G$-invariant way. To this end, define the one-parameter family of vectors
\begin{align}
v_-(\lambda)&=\sin(2\pi\lambda)\ket{-Q}+\cos(2\pi\lambda)\ket{0}&v_+(\lambda)&=\sin(2\pi\lambda)\ket{+Q}+\cos(2\pi\lambda)\ket{0}.
\end{align}
Similarly to our original loop we now let $U(\lambda)=\exp(-iK_1(\lambda))$ and let $V(\lambda)=\exp(-i K_2(\lambda))$ where
\begin{align}
K_1(\lambda)&=i(\ket{0,0}\bra{v_-(\lambda),v_+(\lambda)}-\ket{v_-(\lambda),v_+(\lambda)}\bra{0,0})\\
K_2(\lambda)&=i(\ket{0,0}\bra{v_+(\lambda),v_-(\lambda)}-\ket{v_+(\lambda),v_-(\lambda)}\bra{0,0}).
\end{align}
These will indeed satisfy that $U(0)=V(0)=\id_{\CC^3}$, $U(1)=U$ and $V(1)=V$. Moreover if you create the same depth 2 quantum circuit you will still create a loop (as is displayed in figure \ref{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit_Contraction}).
\subsection{The boundary state}\label{sec:the-boundary-state}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.6}{
		\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/G_InvariantContraction_WithLightcone.tikz}
	}
	\caption{A graphical depiction of the action of the FDQC $\tilde{V}(\lambda)$ on the product state $\ket{\phi}$. The state $\ket{\psi(\lambda)}$ is the boundary state of the loop and is continuous in $\lambda$.}
	\label{fig:G_InvariantContraction_WithLightcone}
\end{figure}
One property that any loop (on any lattice) has is that it has an associated boundary state. In this section, we will construct this boundary state and describe some of its properties. As was the case before, all the pictures made in this section will be on the one-dimensional lattice. They can however be generalized in a straightforward way to higher dimensions.\\\\
Suppose that the loop is generated by some depth-D FDQC $V$. Define $\tilde{V}$ that is constructed by taking all local unitaries of $V$ that have support on the right of the origin and setting all others to $0$ (see figure \ref{fig:G_InvariantContraction_WithLightcone}). Let $\ket{\tilde{\phi}}\defeq \tilde{V}\ket{\phi}$. Take the three local algebras, $\AA_L$, $\AA_C$ and $\AA_R$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:G_InvariantContraction_WithLightcone}. We now get that for any $a\in \AA_L$ and any $b\in\AA_R$
\begin{align}
\bra{\tilde{\phi}}a\ket{\tilde{\phi}}&=\bra{\phi_L}a\ket{\phi_L}&\bra{\tilde{\phi}}b\ket{\tilde{\phi}}&=\bra{\phi_R}b\ket{\phi_R}.
\end{align}
This implies that there must exist a state $\ket{\psi}$ such that
\begin{equation}
\ket{\tilde{\phi}}=\ket{\phi_L}\otimes\ket{\psi}\otimes\ket{\phi_R}.
\end{equation}
We call this state $\ket{\psi}$, the boundary state of $(V,\ket{\phi})$. Some remarks here:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If each layer of the loop is $G$-invariant it is easy to see that the boundary state will be $G$-invariant.
	\item If we have two equivalent loops then their boundary states have to be equivalent as zero-dimensional states.
	\item If we have two $G$-equivalent loops then their boundary states have to be equivalent as $G$-invariant, zero-dimensional states.
	\item In principle, we can define this boundary state also for any lattice of the form $\ZZ^d$ for any positive integer $d$. The boundary state will be a state over the lattice $\ZZ^{d-1}$. However, the last statement that an equivalence of loops implies an equivalence of states is not so trivial anymore. This is because a continuous family of states doesn't necessarily have to be generated by an LGA. The statement is however still believed to be true (this is related to the $\Omega$ spectrum hypotheses in for example \cite{xiong2019classification}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{No $G$-invariant contraction}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.75}{
		\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuitBoundary.tikz}
	}
	\caption{The construction of the boundary state of the loop from figure \ref{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit}.}
	\label{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit_Boundary}
\end{figure}
Now we will show that the $G$-invariant loop presented in Section \ref{sec:classification-of-loops-an-example} cannot have a $G$-invariant contraction. To see this, we first create the boundary state of this loop. This is done in figure \ref{fig:U1_ThoulessPumpAs_FiniteDepthQuantumCircuit_Boundary}. It creates a zero-dimensional SPT state with charge $-Q$.\\\\
Now, suppose there was a family of depth-D FDQCs, $V(\lambda)$ such that $V(0)=\id$ and $V(1)$ generates the loop given in Section \ref{sec:classification-of-loops-an-example}. Let $\ket{\psi(\lambda)}$ be the boundary state of $(V(\lambda),\ket{\phi})$. It has to be a continuous family of states connecting the boundary state of $(V,\ket{\phi})$ to the $G$-invariant product state that is the boundary state of $(\id,\ket{\phi})$. Since the boundary state of $(V,\ket{\phi})$ had charge $-Q$ and the boundary state of $(\id,\ket{\phi})$ has charge $0$, this is not possible. This shows that there does not exist a contraction.\\\\
This allows us to come to the following conjecture that we will prove in chapter \ref{ch:LoopSPT} of this thesis:
\begin{conjecture}
	The classification of $G$-invariant loops is fully determined by the classification of their respective boundary states.
\end{conjecture}
\section{Space groups}
In the last sections, we have looked at the classifications of SPT states and Loops of SPT states respectively. In both of these cases, the symmetry was an on-site symmetry. In this section, we will generalize this assumption and include some other symmetries. We will here ask the question, what if the group action isn't even a finite depth quantum circuit?
\subsection{Translations}
\begin{figure}
	\scalebox{0.7}{
		\input{chapters/SPT_Intro/image/Z_2_and_TranslationInvariantStates.tikz}
	}
	\caption{This is a $G$-invariant finite depth quantum circuit. It is however not translation invariant (Not over one site at least. It is translation invariant over two sites).}
	\label{fig:Z_2_and_TranslationInvariantStates}
\end{figure}
The translation is an automorphism, $\tau$ that takes an element of the operator algebra and shifts its support by one site. A state will be called translation invariant if its expectation value with respect to any translated operator is equal to the original expectation value. More specifically, $\ket{\psi}$ is translation invariant if
\begin{equation}
\bra{\psi}A\ket{\psi}=\bra{\psi}\tau(A)\ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
for all $A\in\AA$. Just like was the case with loops we won't merely look at states that are translation invariant but specifically at $G$-invariant states that are also translation invariant. To this end, we ask that our on-site group action is translation invariant (we associate to each site the same representation).\\\\
We now have to explain what it means for an LGU to be translation invariant. As mentioned before $V(t)$ was an LGU if there is a one-parameter family of Hermitian sum of local terms operators $K(s)$ such that
\begin{equation}
V(t)=\mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_{0}^{t}\d s K(s)).
\end{equation}
Now let's make a choice for these local terms, namely, we take $K_i(s)$, one-parameter families of Hermitian operators. We say that $K(s)$ with this choice of decomposition is translation invariant if for each $i$ there exists a $j$ such that
\begin{equation}
\tau(K_i(s))=K_j(s).
\end{equation}
This should be seen in contrast with the on-site group action where we had that $K(s)$ with this choice of decomposition is $G$-invariant if
\begin{equation}
\Ad{U(g)}(K_i(s))=K_i(s).
\end{equation}
The main question we will be asking in this section is now the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$ be two translation invariant, $G$-invariant SPTs. Suppose there exists a $G$-invariant LGU connecting $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$, does this imply there exists an LGU that is both $G$-invariant and translation invariant that does this? If this does not exist then what is the obstruction to finding this?
\end{itemize}
As an example, consider $G=\ZZ_2$. We will denote the elements of $\ZZ_2$ with multiplicative notation as $1$ and $-1$. We let this group act on the on-site Hilbert space $\CC^2$ through
\begin{align}
U(1)\ket{\uparrow}&=\ket{\uparrow}&U(1)\ket{\downarrow}&=\ket{\downarrow}\\
U(-1)\ket{\uparrow}&=\ket{\uparrow}&U(-1)\ket{\downarrow}&=-\ket{\downarrow}.
\end{align}
The two examples of translation invariant $G$-invariant states that we will consider are the product state with $\ket{\uparrow}$ vectors everywhere which we will call $\ket{\psi_1}$ and the product state with $\ket{\downarrow}$ vectors everywhere which we will call $\ket{\psi_2}$. As is depicted in figure \ref{fig:Z_2_and_TranslationInvariantStates}, these two states can indeed be deformed into one another via a $G$-invariant LGU. Can we find a $G$-invariant LGU that is translation invariant as well? It turns out that the answer to this question is no. The reason why this is the case is that in chapter \ref{ch:TranslationSPT} (or more accurately in appendix \ref{sec:OneDimensionalIndices}) we provide an $H^1(G,\TT)-$valued index for any $G$-invariant, translation invariant state that is invariant under applying $G$-invariant, translation invariant LGUs. If one combines the translation index with the SPT index mentioned previously, one obtains an $H^2(G,\TT)\oplus H^1(G,\TT)$-valued index.
\subsection{Mirror symmetry}
Previously every additional symmetry we imposed just resulted in another index for the classification problem. This seems to be the case for every symmetry that preserves the orientation of the lattice\footnote{I am only talking about the lattices $\ZZ^d$ for which there are no difficulties in defining an orientation}. It turns out however that orientation-reversing symmetries can restrict some of the previous indices. By this, I mean that the cochains that are used to define the SPT index have to satisfy some additional property. This reduces the amount of SPT classes one can get.
\\\\
Remember that we previously classified $G$-symmetric SPTs over the lattice $\ZZ$ by looking at the cochains corresponding to projective representations. We did this by looking at how the state transforms under the group action on the right half of the lattice. Say that the right half of the chain transforms under some projective representation $U_R(g)$. We can do the same with the left half of the chain. Say we call this projective representation $U_L(g)$. Since the full state is $G$-invariant, we require
\begin{equation}
U(g)=U_L(g)\otimes U_R(g)
\end{equation}
to be a linear representation. It turns out that if our state is mirror symmetric (and the group action is as well) there is a unitary, $V\in\UU(\HH_L\otimes\HH_R)$ such that
\begin{equation}
U_L(g)\otimes\id_{\HH_R}=V^\dagger \left(\id_{\HH_L}\otimes U_R(g)\right)V.
\end{equation}
Now let $C:G^2\rightarrow U(1)$ be the 2-cochain such that
\begin{equation}
U_R(g)U_R(h)=C(g,h)U_R(gh)
\end{equation}
then we require that
\begin{equation}
C(g,h)^2=0.
\end{equation}
This means that the amount of $G$-invariant SPTs over $\ZZ$ that are mirror symmetric are partially\footnote{The full index for $G$-invariant SPTs that are mirror symmetric is $\ZZ_2\oplus H^1(G,\TT)\oplus (\ZZ_2\otimes H^2(G,\TT))$.} classified by
\begin{equation}
\ZZ_2\otimes H^2(G,\TT).
\end{equation}
