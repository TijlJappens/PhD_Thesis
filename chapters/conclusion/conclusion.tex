\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

We have shown how the mathematical tools in section \ref{ch:Tools_For_Quantum_many_Body} can be used to produce multiple SPT indices and that these indices are robust and in some cases complete.
\\\\
In chapter \ref{ch:LoopSPT} we had a quasi-local $C^*$-algebra over $\ZZ$. We defined to concept of $G$-loops in definition \ref{def: G-loop} and defined the concept of stable $G$-homotopy in definition \ref{def: stable homotopy}. We then produced an $H^1(G,\TT)$-valued index for $G$-loops which we called the charge pumping index. We then showed that two $G$-loops are stably homotopic if and only if they had the same index. We denoted this result in theorem \ref{thm: classification loops}.
\\\\
In chapter \ref{ch:TranslationSPT} we had a quasi-local $C^*$-algebra over $\ZZ^2$. {\color{red}To be continued...}
